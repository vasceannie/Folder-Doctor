# Folder Organizer

## What does this do?

This simple tool helps you tidy up messy folders on your computer. It takes all the files in a folder you choose and sorts them into new subfolders based on their file types.

## Why is this useful?

- Saves time: No need to manually sort files one by one
- Creates order: Your files are neatly organized by type
- Easy to use: Just run the program and pick a folder to organize

## How to use it

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Download the `cleaner.py` file
3. Run the program
4. A window will pop up asking you to choose a folder
5. Select the folder you want to organize
6. Wait a few seconds, and voila! Your folder is now organized

## What happens to my files?

Don't worry, your files aren't deleted or changed. They're just moved into new subfolders. For example:
- All your images (.jpg, .png, etc.) will go into an "images" folder
- All your documents (.doc, .pdf, etc.) will go into a "documents" folder
- And so on for other file types

## Is it safe?

Yes! This tool doesn't delete anything or send your files anywhere. It just moves them around within the folder you choose.

Happy organizing!
